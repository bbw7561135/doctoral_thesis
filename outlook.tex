\chapter{Outlook}
The upcoming launch of the \textit{James Webb Space Telescope} (JWST) heralds an exciting new era of astronomy. 
For the first time, we will be able to construct a complete timeline of cosmic history from the Big Bang to the present day.
For over a decade, theorists have be hard at work filling the gap in our knowledge between the end of the dark ages and the formation of the first galaxies.
High-redshift galaxies have now been observed up to $z\sim8$, and the JWST is expected to reveal systems with virial masses $M_{\mathrm{vir}} = 10^9\msun$ at $z\simeq10$, just 500 million years after the Big Bang.
While not there just yet, we are rapidly acquiring the ability to explain how these galaxies formed from first principles.
