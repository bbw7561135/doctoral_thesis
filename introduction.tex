\section{From the Big Bang to Now}
How did we get here?  
This is one of the most fundamental questions humanity asks itself.  
At its most basic, this is also the question the field of cosmology attempts to answer: what is the origin of the Universe, how has it evolved over time, and what is its ultimate fate? 
Indeed, the past century has seen remarkable progress in this line of inquiry.
Beginning with Einstein's publication of the general theory of relativity \citep{Einstein1915}, the past 100 years have seen our understanding of the Universe and our place in it revolutionized. 
In the mid-1920s we realized that the Universe is in fact much larger than just our Milky Way Galaxy \citep{Hubble1925}, and the diffuse nebulae observed by astronomers were actually (previously incomprehensibly) distant galaxies similar to our own.
Starting with Hubble's 1929 discovery that the Universe is expanding \citep{Hubble1929}, and finally confirmed by Penzias and Wilson's detection of the Cosmic Microwave Background \citep[CMB;][]{PenziasWilson1965, Dickeetal1965}, a strong body of evidence has led us to the conclusion that the Universe began in a Big Bang and has been expanding ever since.
Other observations have since revealed that the overwhelming majority of the mass in the Universe is actually composed of invisible dark matter \citep{Rubin}, and the normal baryonic matter comprising all stars, planets, and every living thing accounts for only about a fifth of the total mass budget. 
In fact, normal matter constitutes an even smaller 4\% of the total energy content of the Universe, with the majority consisting of dark energy, the phenomenon responsible for the observed acceleration of the Universe's expansion\citep{universeacceleration}.
Most recently the advent of precision cosmology, led by high resolution studies of the CMB, has allowed us to determine the age, composition, and shape of the Universe with multiple-digit precision.  
This has led to the conclusion that we live in a flat universe which is 13.8 billion years old and composed primarily of dark energy and dark matter \citep{PlanckParams2015}.

While studies of the CMB have revealed much about the Universe on large scales, the CMB also provides a detailed picture of what the Universe looked like when atoms were first forming, $\sim$400,000 years after the Big Bang. 
However, the Universe thus revealed had little in common with the Universe we observe today.  
At these early times, matter and radiation were distributed quite evenly, and deviations from perfect uniformity were only present on the level of one part in 100,000---a far cry from the complex, highly structured tapestry of planets, stars, and galaxies we see today.
As even our deepest current observations reveal a Universe which is already highly structured, precisely how this transition occurred is one of the primary frontiers of modern cosmology.

When the next generation of astronomical facilities---including the \textit{Square Kilometer Array} (SKA), \textit{James Webb Space Telescope} (JWST), and 30-meter class ground-based telescopes like the \textit{Giant Magellan Telescope} (GMT)--- come online, they will allow us to peer much farther through space and time, opening even earlier epochs to observation.
The JWST in particular is expected to reveal the formation of the first galaxies at $z\simeq10$, and a detailed understanding of how these structures form will be crucial to interpreting the findings of these next-generation observatories.
Coupled with ever more sophisticated simulations enabled by advances in both technology and technique, we are rapidly approaching completion of a continuous timeline of cosmic history. 
By connecting \textit{ab-initio}, state-of-the-art cosmological simulations of structure formation to next-generation observations we will for the first time be able to construct a complete picture of cosmic evolution, stretching all the way from the simple initial conditions of the early universe to the present epoch.

\section{Cosmic Renaissance}
%The JWST is expected to reveal the era of the first galaxies, but the first stars themselves---the so-called Population III (Pop III)---will likely remain out of reach. 
%While clusters of Pop III stars may be marginally detectable under optimal conditions \citep{Safranek-Shraderetal2012}, bridging the gap between the production of the CMB and the era of the first galaxies is a task that will largely fall to theory.

The basic process by which the first stars and galaxies form has been thoroughly established within the standard $\Lambda$CDM model for hierarchical structure formation.
Following the release of the CMB, cosmic evolution during the `dark ages' was relatively simple, with small perturbations in the density of cold dark matter 
growing slowly under the influence of gravity.
These over-densities eventually coalesce into gravitationally bound `minihalos,' within which the first stars formed at $z\lesssim50$, initiating a cosmic `renaissance' and marking a significant increase in the complexity of cosmic evolution \citep{BarkanaLoeb2001, Miralda-Escude2003, Brommetal2009, Loeb2010}.
The light from these stars swept through the Universe, beginning the process of reionization \citep[e.g.,][]{Meiksin2009}, while the heavy elements forged in their cores and released in the violent supernova explosions marking their deaths began the process of chemical enrichment \citep[e.g.,][]{KarlssonBrommHawthorn2013}.
Since structure in our $\Lambda$CDM Universe forms in a hierarchical manner, such that the dark matter halos hosting the first galaxies are built up from smaller progenitors which hosted the first stars, Pop III stars have a direct impact on the formation and evolution of all subsequent stages of galaxy formation, and thus are thus key drivers of cosmic evolution \citep{Bromm2013}.  

While the complex baryonic physics involved have so far prevented a definitive answer to this question, the basic properties of these Pop III stars have been reasonably well established, with the consensus that the first stars formed in dark matter minihalos on the order of $10^5-10^6$ solar masses at redshifts $z \simeq 20-30$ \citep{CouchmanRees1986,   HaimanThoulLoeb1996, Tegmarketal1997}.  
In the absence of any feedback, pioneering numerical work on the collapse of primordial gas into these halos, where molecular hydrogen is the only available coolant, suggested that the first stars were predominantly very massive, on the order of $100$\msun with a top-heavy initial mass function (IMF) (e.g., \citealt{BrommCoppiLarson1999, BrommCoppiLarson2002, AbelBryanNorman2002, BrommLarson2004, Yoshidaetal2006, OSheaNorman2007}).  
More recent work, aided by increased resolution, has revised this picture, finding that significant fragmentation occurs during the star formation process, resulting in lower characteristic masses and a much broader IMF than previously thought \citep{StacyGreifBromm2010,Clarketal2011a,Clarketal2011b,Greifetal2011,Greifetal2012,StacyBromm2013,Hiranoetal2014,Hosokawaetal2015}. This has led to an emerging consensus that the Pop III initial mass function (IMF) was somewhat top-heavy with a characteristic mass of $\sim$ a few $\times 10\msun$ \citep{Bromm2013}. 

While the formation of the very first stars is set by cosmological initial conditions, the formation of all subsequent generations is much more complex due to the feedback processes initiated by that very first episode of primordial star formation.
The characteristic mass of the first stars is therefore crucial, as it largely determines the influence Pop III stars have on their environment, controlling both their total luminosity and ionizing radiation output \citep{Schaerer2002}, as well as the details of their eventual demise \citep{Hegeretal2003,HegerWoosley2010,MaederMeynet2012}, thus setting the initial conditions for the formation of the first galaxies.

One key factor in properly modeling galaxy formation is supernova feedback, both through direct mechanical feedback from the explosion itself, and through the chemical enrichment process.
